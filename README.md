# BBCSDL
BBC BASIC for SDL 2.0 is a cross-platform implementation of the BBC BASIC programming language for
Windows, Linux (x86), MacOS, Raspbian (Raspberry Pi), Android, iOS and Emscripten / WebAssembly.
It is highly compatible with BBC BASIC for Windows and has the same language extensions, but uses
SDL 2.0 as an OS abstraction layer to achieve cross-platform compatibility.
